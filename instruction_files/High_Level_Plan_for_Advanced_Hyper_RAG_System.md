## Plan Overview

### 1. System Architecture Design
- **Modular Components**: Define clear modular components for each functionality to ensure scalability and maintainability.
- **Layered Approach**:
  - **Input Layer**: Document ingestion and segmentation.
  - **Processing Layer**: Embedding, knowledge extraction, and graph construction.
  - **Storage Layer**: Local storage of embeddings, graphs, and processed data.
  - **Retrieval Layer**: Hybrid search combining graph-based and dense vector search.
  - **Presentation Layer**: User interface for input, retrieval results, and configuration.

### 2. Core Functionalities

#### a. Document Processing
- Segment documents into smaller chunks suitable for embedding.
- Support diverse input types (PDF, DOCX, TXT).

#### b. Information Embedding and Retrieval
- Extract embeddings using offline-compatible models.
- Store embeddings locally for efficient similarity searches.

#### c. Contextual Ranking
- Rank retrieved information based on its relevance to the query using a scoring mechanism.

#### d. Knowledge Graph Construction
- Identify entities, relationships, and properties from text.
- Build a graph with nodes and edges for structured knowledge representation.

#### e. Graph-Based Information Retrieval
- Use graph traversal techniques to retrieve relationships and context.

#### f. Data Deduplication
- Identify and remove duplicate results during retrieval and ranking stages.

#### g. Hybrid Search Capability
- Combine unstructured (semantic) and structured (graph) retrieval methods.
- Allow switching between hybrid and dense-only modes.

#### h. Parallel Processing
- Utilize threading or multiprocessing to process multiple documents or queries simultaneously.

#### i. Error and Timeout Management
- Handle errors gracefully and ensure task completion within a specified time limit.

#### j. Result Formatting
- Present retrieved information in an organized, user-friendly format.

#### k. Dynamic Adaptability
- Enable customization of entity types, relationships, or processing logic based on user requirements.

#### l. Translator Support
- Provide a built-in translator to convert user queries from Arabic to English.
- Ensure seamless integration for Arabic-speaking users seeking English documents.

### 3. Offline Functionality
- Ensure all models (LLMs, embedding models) and data are accessible offline.
- Leverage pre-trained models stored locally.
- Integrate a lightweight local database for embeddings and graph storage (e.g., SQLite, Neo4j).

### 4. Integration with Existing Docker Image
- Reuse the existing Docker image as a base if feasible.
- Extend functionality to incorporate new features while maintaining compatibility.

### 5. Performance Optimization
- Optimize for local resource constraints (CPU, RAM).
- Implement batch processing for large datasets.
- Use indexing techniques (e.g., FAISS) for efficient similarity search.

### 6. User Interface
- Design a user-friendly interface for:
  - Document input.
  - Querying and result display.
  - Configurations and settings.

### 7. Testing and Validation
- Define test cases for each functionality.
- Validate against a benchmark of queries and datasets to ensure accuracy and efficiency.

### 8. Packaging and Distribution
- Use packaging tools to create an installable app.
- Ensure compatibility with Windows OS.
- Provide clear installation instructions and user documentation.
