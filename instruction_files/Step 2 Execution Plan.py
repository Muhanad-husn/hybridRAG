# Step 2 Execution Plan: Architecture & Design

## 1. System Architecture Blueprint
- Utilize LLMSherpa for document processing and Ollama for LLM deployments as key modular components.
- Include additional components as needed during the implementation of subsequent steps.
- Ensure each module remains loosely coupled for maintainability and scalability.

## 2. Data Flow & Component Interaction
- Define the data flow between modules, ensuring:
  - Input data (e.g., documents) flows through LLMSherpa for processing.
  - Processed data interacts seamlessly with embedding generation and graph construction modules.
  - Retrieval systems (both vector-based and graph-based) receive preprocessed inputs for hybrid search.
- Use default protocols that match the data types for communication between modules.

## 3. Technical Document Creation
- Follow best practices to create detailed internal design documents, including:
  - Module responsibilities and interaction points.
  - API and function interface definitions for embedding, graph storage, and retrieval.
  - Integration details for LLMSherpa and Ollama with other components.
- Ensure modularity and reusability in design.

## 4. Performance Optimization Considerations
- Delay performance optimization until implementation reveals potential bottlenecks.
- Address resource constraints, such as limited RAM or CPU, during implementation as needed.

## 5. Testing & Validation Preparation
- Design comprehensive test cases for the interaction between modules, including:
  - Embedding generation to graph storage integration.
  - Graph-based and vector-based retrieval mechanisms.
- Use provided actual project data to test functionality and data flow integrity.
- Ensure modules conform to expected outputs for end-to-end workflows.

## Conclusion
This plan ensures the architecture and design phase aligns with project requirements, leveraging LLMSherpa and Ollama effectively while maintaining modularity, scalability, and adherence to best practices. Testing protocols will validate the robustness of the design using real project data.
