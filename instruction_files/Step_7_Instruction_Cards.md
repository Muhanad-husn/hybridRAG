# Step 7 Instruction Cards: Packaging and Distribution

## **7_1: Model Packaging**

**Objective**: Prepare and package models for offline use.

### Instructions:
1. **Model Selection**:
   - Identify all models used in the system (e.g., embedding, translation, LLMs).

2. **Tool**:
   - Use model serialization tools like `pickle` or `torch.save` for PyTorch-based models.

3. **Storage**:
   - Store packaged models in a designated folder within the app directory.

4. **Validation**:
   - Verify that all models load correctly in the application.

5. **Output**:
   - Packaged models ready for offline use.

## **7_2: Data Bundling**

**Objective**: Bundle required datasets and configuration files.

### Instructions:
1. **File Collection**:
   - Gather datasets, precomputed embeddings, and configuration files.

2. **Tool**:
   - Use standard file compression tools (`zip`, `tar.gz`) for bundling.

3. **Storage**:
   - Store bundled files in the app directory, ensuring paths are configurable.

4. **Validation**:
   - Verify that all bundled files are accessible and correctly loaded by the application.

5. **Output**:
   - A compressed archive of data files included in the package.

## **7_3: Application Bundling**

**Objective**: Package the app into a Windows-compatible `.exe` format.

### Instructions:
1. **Setup**:
   - Prepare the application entry point (e.g., `main.py`).

2. **Tool**:
   - Use tools like `PyInstaller` or `cx_Freeze` to generate a `.exe`.

3. **Packaging**:
   - Include all dependencies (models, datasets, libraries) in the package.

4. **Validation**:
   - Test the `.exe` file to ensure the app runs without errors.

5. **Output**:
   - A standalone `.exe` file for Windows.

## **7_4: Installation and User Guide**

**Objective**: Create documentation for installation and basic usage.

### Instructions:
1. **Content**:
   - Provide step-by-step instructions for installing and running the `.exe` file.

2. **Tool**:
   - Use Markdown or a simple text editor to draft the guide.

3. **Sections**:
   - System requirements.
   - Installation steps.
   - Basic usage examples.

4. **Validation**:
   - Verify the guideâ€™s clarity by having a test user follow it.

5. **Output**:
   - A concise installation and usage guide.

## **7_5: Testing Installation**

**Objective**: Test the installation process on different Windows environments.

### Instructions:
1. **Test Cases**:
   - Run the `.exe` on various Windows versions (e.g., Windows 10, 11).

2. **Validation**:
   - Ensure the application installs and operates as expected.

3. **Tool**:
   - Use test machines or virtual environments for testing.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Document any installation errors and provide quick fixes.

5. **Output**:
   - A report detailing the installation test results.
