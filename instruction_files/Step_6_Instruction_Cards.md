# Step 6 Instruction Cards: Testing and Validation

## **6_1: Module-Level Testing**

**Objective**: Test each module in isolation to validate functionality and error handling.

### Instructions:
1. **Test Cases**:
   - Document Processing: Test file ingestion and segmentation for supported formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT).
   - Embedding Generation: Validate embedding dimensions and similarity computations.
   - Knowledge Graph Construction: Check entity and relationship extraction for schema compliance.
   - Retrieval Mechanisms: Test hybrid retrieval results for query relevance.

2. **Tool**:
   - Use `pytest` for writing and executing unit tests.

3. **Input**:
   - Sample files and datasets mimicking real-world scenarios.

4. **Validation**:
   - Verify outputs against expected results.
   - Ensure errors are handled gracefully.

5. **Output**:
   - Pass/fail logs with detailed descriptions.

## **6_2: Integration Testing**

**Objective**: Test combined workflows across all modules for consistency and correctness.

### Instructions:
1. **Test Cases**:
   - Workflow: Document ingestion → Embedding → Retrieval → Knowledge Graph.
   - Data Flow: Ensure consistent data transformations between modules.

2. **Tool**:
   - Use `pytest` with fixtures to simulate workflows.

3. **Input**:
   - Combined datasets from document processing and retrieval pipelines.

4. **Validation**:
   - Check that outputs from each stage align with the next module’s input requirements.

5. **Output**:
   - Logs capturing success/failure of entire workflows.

## **6_3: Performance Testing**

**Objective**: Measure system efficiency and identify bottlenecks.

### Instructions:
1. **Metrics**:
   - Time taken for document processing, embedding generation, and retrieval.
   - Memory and CPU utilization during execution.

2. **Tool**:
   - Use `pytest-benchmark` for detailed performance metrics.

3. **Input**:
   - Large datasets to simulate heavy workloads.

4. **Validation**:
   - Ensure no significant delays or memory issues for realistic query loads.

5. **Output**:
   - Performance benchmarks with detailed logs.

## **6_4: Robustness Validation**

**Objective**: Test system behavior under unexpected or incomplete inputs.

### Instructions:
1. **Test Cases**:
   - Queries with unsupported formats or languages.
   - Incomplete or malformed documents.
   - Mixed-language inputs.

2. **Tool**:
   - Use `pytest` with parameterized tests for diverse inputs.

3. **Input**:
   - Custom datasets designed for edge-case scenarios.

4. **Validation**:
   - Verify fallback mechanisms and error logs.

5. **Output**:
   - Logs confirming robustness and graceful degradation.

## **6_5: Automated Test Framework**

**Objective**: Automate continuous testing with actionable reports.

### Instructions:
1. **Setup**:
   - Create a `pytest` test suite combining all sub-tests.
   - Configure a CI/CD pipeline for automatic execution.

2. **Tool**:
   - Use `pytest` with plugins (e.g., `pytest-html`, `pytest-cov`) for detailed reporting.

3. **Input**:
   - All test cases and scenarios from 6_1 to 6_4.

4. **Validation**:
   - Validate that all tests are automatically executed, with reports generated.

5. **Output**:
   - Consolidated reports summarizing test results and coverage.
