# Step 5 Execution Plan: Translation

**Objective**: Implement a translation layer to handle bilingual interactions (Arabic and English) in user queries and LLM outputs. The translation should be seamless and integrated within the system workflow, ensuring high usability for Arabic-speaking users.

## Instructions

1. **User Query Translation**:
   - **Input Check**: Determine if the user query is in Arabic.
     - Use a language detection mechanism to identify the language of the input text.
   - **Translate Query**:
     - If the query is in Arabic, translate it into English before processing.
     - Use a lightweight, locally operable translation tool or API to ensure offline compatibility.

2. **Processing**:
   - Pass the translated English query to the subsequent processing modules (e.g., embedding generation, hybrid retrieval).
   - Ensure that no additional formatting or templates are imposed during the translation process.

3. **LLM Output Translation**:
   - **Output Check**:
     - If the input query was originally in Arabic, ensure the final LLM response is translated back to Arabic.
   - **Translate Output**:
     - Use the same translation tool to convert the output from English to Arabic.

4. **Integration**:
   - Incorporate the translation mechanism as a modular pre- and post-processing step.
   - Ensure that the translation module integrates seamlessly without affecting the performance or output of the main retrieval and reasoning pipeline.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Log any translation errors (e.g., unsupported language, tool failure) and provide fallback mechanisms.
     - If translation fails, return the original English response with a warning about the failure.
   - Ensure robust handling of edge cases, such as mixed-language queries.

6. **Testing**:
   - Test with diverse queries, including:
     - Fully Arabic queries.
     - Mixed-language queries.
     - Queries requiring idiomatic or contextual understanding.
   - Validate the accuracy and relevance of translated queries and outputs.

7. **Output Requirements**:
   - No standardized format or templates for translated outputs; preserve the original intent and structure.
   - Maintain the natural tone and phrasing of the translated text.

**Dependencies**:
- Language detection and translation tools.
- Modules for query embedding, ranking, and retrieval, as implemented in previous steps.

**Outcome**:
Seamless bilingual query handling, allowing users to interact with the system naturally in Arabic while leveraging the full capabilities of the English LLM and retrieval pipeline.
