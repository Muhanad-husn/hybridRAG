2. Embedding Generation
- Uses GTE-Small model for generating embeddings
- Efficient batch processing
- GPU acceleration when available

3. Knowledge Graph Construction
- Entity and relationship extraction
- Graph database storage using ArangoDB
- Flexible schema for various domain types

4. Hybrid Retrieval
- Combines graph-based and dense vector search
- Advanced reranking using FlashRank
- Deduplication of search results

5. Multilingual Support
- Arabic to English translation
- Bidirectional query processing
- Preservation of context during translation

The system is designed for educational and research purposes, providing a robust framework for information retrieval and knowledge management.
